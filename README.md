# Springboard Data Science Career Track

Hi!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and this is my repo for the Springboard Data Science Track. 

From Oct 2018 to April 2019 I completed a number of projects, including two capstones, as part of the DS track. 

All of the documentation, code, and notes can be found here, as well as links to other resources I found helpful for successfully completing the program. 

For questions or comments, please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikikobazeley/). 

Regards,
Mikiko

## Capstone Project: Building a Data Product
The capstone project is a key part of our curriculum that every student must complete.
The projects are designed to provide you with the experience of working in a realistic data
science scenario. Working with your mentor, you'll pick a data set and a problem of
interest. From start to finish, your project will be targeted to a specific client (real or
imaginary). Using the data science techniques, you've learned, you'll not only come up
with a reasonable solution to the problem, but learn to present it to them as a compelling
story.
       You will work on two capstone projects that involve the following:
              1. Formulating a problem based on exploratory data analysis;
              2. Building a model and transforming data so that it can be input to an algorithm;
              3. Iteratively evaluating performance, and adapting model/data input to figure out if
              more data or a different algorithm is needed to best solve the problem.
              If you choose one of our specialization tracks, your second capstone project will be
              related directly to the specialization of your choice.
