--------------------Introduction and Lists -------------------------------------

Container Sequences - Hold other types of data
Sepcific container sequences -inc lists, dictionarys, tuples

Lists -
  Hold data in order it was added
  Mutable

  Ex: List
                  cookies = ['chocolate chip', 'peanut butter', 'oatmeal', 'sugar']
                  coookies.append('Tirggel')       #add new items to lists using the append method
                  print(cookies)
                  print(cookies[2])
                  
                  
 Combining lists
        Can either use operator or .extend() - merges a list into another list at the end
        
        Operator method (1):
        
                  cakes = ['strawberry', 'vanilla']
                  desserts = cookies + cakes
                  print(desserts)
                  
        Extends Method (2):

Find and Remove Elements in a List
