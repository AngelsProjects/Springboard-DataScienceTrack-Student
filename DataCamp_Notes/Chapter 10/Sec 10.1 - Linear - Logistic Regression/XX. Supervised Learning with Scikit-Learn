Supervised Learning with scikit-learn
Course Description
At the end of day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

Classification

In this chapter, you will be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. Classification problems are prevalent in a variety of domains, ranging from finance to healthcare. Here, you will have the chance to apply what you are learning to a political dataset, where you classify the party affiliation of United States Congressmen based on their voting records.


What is machine learning?
● The art and science of:
			● Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data

Numerical EDA
In this chapter, you'll be working with a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of votes made by US House of Representatives Congressmen. Your goal will be to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues. Here, it's worth noting that we have preprocessed this dataset to deal with missing values. This is so that your focus can be directed towards understanding how to train and evaluate supervised learning models. Once you have mastered these fundamentals, you will be introduced to preprocessing techniques in Chapter 4 and have the chance to apply them there yourself - including on this very same dataset!

Before thinking about what supervised learning models you can apply to this, however, you need to perform Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to understand the structure of the data. For a refresher on the importance of EDA, check out the first two chapters of Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1).

Get started with your EDA now by exploring this voting records dataset numerically. It has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called df. Use pandas' .head(), .info(), and .describe() methods in the IPython Shell to explore the DataFrame, and select the statement below that is not true.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Visual EDA
The Numerical EDA you did in the previous exercise gave you some very important information, such as the names and data types of the columns, and the dimensions of the DataFrame. Following this with some visual EDA will give you an even better understanding of the data. In the video, Hugo used the scatter_matrix() function on the Iris data for this purpose. However, you may have noticed in the previous exercise that all the features in this dataset are binary; that is, they are either 0 or 1. So a different type of plot would be more useful here, such as Seaborn's countplot.

Given on the right is a countplot of the 'education' bill, generated from the following code:

plt.figure()
sns.countplot(x='education', hue='party', data=df, palette='RdBu')
plt.xticks([0,1], ['No', 'Yes'])
plt.show()
In sns.countplot(), we specify the x-axis data to be 'education', and hue to be 'party'. Recall that 'party' is also our target variable. So the resulting plot shows the difference in voting behavior between the two parties for the 'education' bill, with each party colored differently. We manually specified the color to be 'RdBu', as the Republican party has been traditionally associated with red, and the Democratic party with blue.

It seems like Democrats voted resoundingly against this bill, compared to Republicans. This is the kind of information that our machine learning model will seek to learn when we try to predict party affiliation solely based on voting behavior. An expert in U.S politics may be able to predict this without machine learning, but probably not instantaneously - and certainly not if we are dealing with hundreds of samples!

In the IPython Shell, explore the voting behavior further by generating countplots for the 'satellite' and 'missile' bills, and answer the following question: Of these two bills, for which ones do Democrats vote resoundingly in favor of, compared to Republicans? Be sure to begin your plotting statements for each figure with plt.figure() so that a new figure will be set up. Otherwise, your plots will be overlayed onto the same figure.

Using scikit-learn to fit a classifier
In [1]: from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
In [2]: knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)
In [3]: knn.fit(iris['data'], iris['target'])
		Out[3]: KNeighborsClassifier(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30,

k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit
Having explored the Congressional voting records dataset, it is time now to build your first classifier. In this exercise, you will fit a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to the voting dataset, which has once again been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame df.

In the video, Hugo discussed the importance of ensuring your data adheres to the format required by the scikit-learn API. The features need to be in an array where each column is a feature and each row a different observation or data point - in this case, a Congressman's voting record. The target needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data. We have done this for you in this exercise. Notice we named the feature array X and response variable y: This is in accordance with the common scikit-learn practice.

Your job is to create an instance of a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors (by specifying the n_neighbors parameter) and then fit it to the data. The data has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df.

Instructions
100 XP
Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
Create arrays X and y for the features and the target variable. Here this has been done for you. Note the use of .drop() to drop the target variable 'party' from the feature array X as well as the use of the .values attribute to ensure X and y are NumPy arrays. Without using .values, X and y are a DataFrame and Series respectively; the scikit-learn API will accept them in this form also as long as they are of the right shape.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors by specifying the n_neighbors parameter.
Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict
Having fit a k-NN classifier, you can now use it to predict the label of a new data point. However, there is no unlabeled data available since all of it was used to fit the model! You can still use the .predict() method on the X that was used to fit the model, but it is not a good indicator of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the next video, Hugo will discuss a solution to this problem. For now, a random unlabeled data point has been generated and is available to you as X_new. You will use your classifier to predict the label for this new data point, as well as on the training data X that the model has already seen. Using .predict() on X_new will generate 1 prediction, while using it on X will generate 435 predictions: 1 for each sample.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df. This time, you will create the feature array X and target variable array y yourself.

new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))

Measuring model
performance

Measuring model performance
● In classification, accuracy is a commonly used metric
● Accuracy = Fraction of correct predictions
● Which data should be used to compute accuracy?
● How well will the model perform on new data?


Measuring model performance
● Could compute accuracy on data used to fit classifier
	● NOT indicative of ability to generalize
● Split data into training and test set
	● Fit/train the classifier on the training set
	● Make predictions on test set
	● Compare predictions with the known labels

	

Train/test split 

In [1]: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
In [2]: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =
 ...: train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
 ...: random_state=21, stratify=y)
In [3]: knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=8)
In [4]: knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
In [5]: y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
In [6]: print("Test set predictions:\n {}".format(y_pred))
Test set predictions:
 [2 1 2 2 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 0 0
 1 2 2 0 0 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 0 2 1]
In [7]: knn.score(X_test, y_test)
		Out[7]: 0.9555555555555556	
	
	

Model complexity
● Larger k = smoother decision boundary = less complex model
● Smaller k = more complex model = can lead to overfi"ing

The digits recognition dataset
Up until now, you have been performing binary classification, since the target variable had two possible outcomes. Hugo, however, got to perform multi-class classification in the videos, where the target variable could take on three possible outcomes. Why does he get to have all the fun?! In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the MNIST dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one we will use in this exercise.

Each sample in this scikit-learn dataset is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit. Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating varying levels of black. Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type Bunch, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an 'images' key in addition to the 'data' and 'target' keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this 'images' key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.

Notice that you can access the keys of these Bunch objects in two different ways: By using the . notation, as in digits.images, or the [] notation, as in digits['images'].

For more on the MNIST data, check out this exercise in Part 1 of DataCamp's Importing Data in Python course. There, the full version of the MNIST dataset is used, in which the images are 28x28. It is a famous dataset in machine learning and computer vision, and frequently used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of a new model.

    Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set
    ===================================================
    
    Notes
    -----
    Data Set Characteristics:
        :Number of Instances: 5620
        :Number of Attributes: 64
        :Attribute Information: 8x8 image of integer pixels in the range 0..16.
        :Missing Attribute Values: None
        :Creator: E. Alpaydin (alpaydin '@' boun.edu.tr)

    This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets
    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits
    
    The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where
    each class refers to a digit.
    
    Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract
    normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a
    total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13
    to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of
    4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates
    an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range
    0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small
    distortions.

Train/Test Split + Fit/Predict/Accuracy
Now that you have learned about the importance of splitting your data into training and test sets, it's time to practice doing this on the digits dataset! After creating arrays for the features and target variable, you will split them into training and test sets, fit a k-NN classifier to the training data, and then compute its accuracy using the .score() method.

Instructions
100 XP
Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Create an array for the features using digits.data and an array for the target using digits.target.
Create stratified training and test sets using 0.2 for the size of the test set. Use a random state of 42. Stratify the split according to the labels so that they are distributed in the training and test sets as they are in the original dataset.
Create a k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors and fit it to the training data.
Compute and print the accuracy of the classifier's predictions using the .score() method.


# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create feature and target arrays
X = digits.data
y = digits.target

# Split into training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Create a k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the accuracy
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Overfitting and underfitting
Remember the model complexity curve that Hugo showed in the video? You will now construct such a curve for the digits dataset! In this exercise, you will compute and plot the training and testing accuracy scores for a variety of different neighbor values. By observing how the accuracy scores differ for the training and testing sets with different values of k, you will develop your intuition for overfitting and underfitting.

The training and testing sets are available to you in the workspace as X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test. In addition, KNeighborsClassifier has been imported from sklearn.neighbors.

Instructions
100 XP
Inside the for loop:
Setup a k-NN classifier with the number of neighbors equal to k.
Fit the classifier with k neighbors to the training data.
Compute accuracy scores the training set and test set separately using the .score() method and assign the results to the train_accuracy and test_accuracy arrays respectively.


# Setup arrays to store train and test accuracies
neighbors = np.arange(1, 9)
train_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))
test_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))

# Loop over different values of k
for i, k in enumerate(neighbors):
    # Setup a k-NN Classifier with k neighbors: knn
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k)

    # Fit the classifier to the training data
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    #Compute accuracy on the training set
    train_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_train, y_train)

    #Compute accuracy on the testing set
    test_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_test, y_test)

# Generate plot
plt.title('k-NN: Varying Number of Neighbors')
plt.plot(neighbors, test_accuracy, label = 'Testing Accuracy')
plt.plot(neighbors, train_accuracy, label = 'Training Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Number of Neighbors')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.show()


Great work! It looks like the test accuracy is highest when using 3 and 5 neighbors. Using 8 neighbors or more seems to result in a simple model that underfits the data. Now that you've grasped the fundamentals of classification, you will learn about regression in the next chapter!


Hint
Use KNeighborsClassifier() to instantiate the classifier and specify the number of neighbors to be k with n_neighbors=k.
Use the .fit() method with X_train and y_train as arguments to fit the classifier to the training data.
Use the .score() method on knn with X_train and y_train as arguments to compute the training set accuracy and then with X_test and y_test as arguments to compute the test set accuracy.

Regression

In the previous chapter, you made use of image and political datasets to predict binary as well as multiclass outcomes. But what if your problem requires a continuous outcome? Regression, which is the focus of this chapter, is best suited to solving such problems. You will learn about fundamental concepts in regression and apply them to predict the life expectancy in a given country using Gapminder data.



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3
Fine-tuning your model

Having trained your model, your next task is to evaluate its performance. What metrics can you use to gauge how good your model is? So far, you have used accuracy for classification and R-squared for regression. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn that will allow you to assess your model's performance in a more nuanced manner. You will then learn to optimize both your classification as well as regression models using hyperparameter tuning.





_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4
Preprocessing and pipelines

This chapter will introduce the notion of pipelines and how scikit-learn allows for transformers and estimators to be chained together and used as a single unit. Pre-processing techniques will be then be introduced as a way to enhance model performance and pipelines will be the glue that ties together concepts in the prior chapters.
