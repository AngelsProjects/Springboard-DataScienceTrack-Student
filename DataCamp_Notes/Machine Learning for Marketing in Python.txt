INTERACTIVE COURSE
Machine Learning for Marketing in Python


Course Description
The rise of machine learning (almost sounds like "rise of the machines"?) and applications of statistical methods to marketing have changed the field forever. Machine learning is being used to optimize customer journeys which maximize their satisfaction and lifetime value. This course will give you the foundational tools which you can immediately apply to improve your companyâ€™s marketing strategy. You will learn how to use different techniques to predict customer churn and interpret its drivers, measure, and forecast customer lifetime value, and finally, build customer segments based on their product purchase patterns. You will use customer data from a telecom company to predict churn, construct a recency-frequency-monetary dataset from an online retailer for customer lifetime value prediction, and build customer segments from product purchase data from a grocery shop.

Machine learning for marketing basics

In this chapter, you will explore the basics of machine learning methods used in marketing. You will learn about different types of machine learning, data preparation steps, and will run several end to end models to understand their power.

Types of machine learning
Supervised learning
Given X, can we predict Y?
Classication - when Y is categorical (e.g.Churned/Not-churned, Yes/No, Fish/Dog/Cat).
Regression - when Y is continuous (e.g. Purchases,Clicks, Time Spent on Website).
Unsupervised learning
Given X, can we detect patterns and clusters that are homogenous?
Reinforcement learning
Given a current state and a number potential actions, which path maximizes the reward?


Supervised learning data parts and steps
1. Dene the target (dependent variable orY) - what do we want to predict?
Example 1 - which customers will churn?[CLASSIFICATION]
Example 2 - which customers will buy again?[CLASSIFICATION]
Example 3 - how much will customers spend in the next 30 days?[REGRESSION]
2. Collect features (independent variables orX) which could have predictive power:
Example 1 - Purchase patterns prior churning.
Example 2 - Number of missed loan payments prior defaulting on a loan.


Supervised learning data format
X by N+1 matrix:
X number of observations (customer, vendor, product)
N + 1 number of columns (N features + 1 target variable)
Feature 1 Feature 2 ... Feature N Target Y
11 21 N1 Y1
12 22 N2 Y2


Unsupervised learning
Collect usage or purchase data and run modelto identify homogenous groups i.e. clusters or segments of
data:
Example 1 - customer segmentation by their product purchases.
Example 2 - product segmentation for bundling



Unsupervised learning data format
X by N matrix:
X number of observations (customer, vendor, product)
N number of columns (N features)
A list ofindependent variables (features) as separate columns for each observation
Feature 1 Feature 2 ... Feature N
11 21 N1
12 22 N2

Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
Great work! You now know a lot about the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning. For this exercise, a telecom churn dataset named telco has been loaded for you. The last column called Churn defines whether or not a specific customer has churned. You will explore this dataset and determine whether it fits the supervised or unsupervised data format.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP

Print the first 5 rows of the telco dataset by printing its header.

# Print header of telco dataset
print(telco.head())

Separate categorical and numerical columns
Separate the identier and target variable names as lists
custid = ['customerID']
target = ['Churn']
Separate categorical and numeric column names as lists
categorical = telco_raw.nunique()[telcom.nunique()<10].keys().tolist()
categorical.remove(target[0])
numerical = [col for col in telco_raw.columns
if col not in custid+target+categorical]


One-hot encoding categorical variables
One-hot encoding categorical variables
telco_raw = pd.get_dummies(data=telco_raw, columns=categorical, drop_first=True)



Scaling numerical features
# Import StandardScaler library
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
# Initialize StandardScaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()
# Fit the scaler to numerical columns
scaled_numerical = scaler.fit_transform(telco_raw[numerical])
# Build a DataFrame
scaled_numerical = pd.DataFrame(scaled_numerical, columns=numerical)



Bringing it all together
# Drop non-scaled numerical columns
telco_raw = telco_raw.drop(columns=numerical, axis=1)
# Merge the non-numerical with the scaled numerical data
telco = telco_raw.merge(right=scaled_numerical,
how=
'left'
,
left_index=True,
right_index=True
)
