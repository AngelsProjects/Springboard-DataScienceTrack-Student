Course Description
From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, you'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance.

In this chapter you'll be introduced to the ideas of correlation and autocorrelation for time series. Correlation describes the relationship between two time series and autocorrelation describes the relationship of a time series with its past values.

A "Thin" Application of Time Series
Google Trends allows users to see how often a term is searched for. We downloaded a file from Google Trends containing the frequency over time for the search word "diet", which is pre-loaded in a DataFrame called diet. A first step when analyzing a time series is to visualize the data with a plot. You should be able to clearly see a gradual decrease in searches for "diet" throughout the calendar year, hitting a low around the December holidays, followed by a spike in searches around the new year as people make New Year's resolutions to lose weight.

Like many time series datasets you will be working with, the index of dates are strings and should be converted to a datetime index before plotting.

This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the pandas basics Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

Convert the date index to datetime using pandas's to_datetime()


# Import pandas and plotting modules
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convert the date index to datetime
diet.index = pd.to_datetime(diet.index)


Plot the time series and set the argument grid to True to better see the year-ends.

# From previous step
diet.index = pd.to_datetime(diet.index)

# Plot the entire time series diet and show gridlines
diet.plot(grid=True)
plt.show()


Slice the diet dataset to keep only values from 2012, assigning to diet2012.
Plot the diet2012, again creating gridlines with the grid argument.


# From previous step
diet.index = pd.to_datetime(diet.index)

# Slice the dataset to keep only 2012
diet2012 = diet['2012']

# Plot 2012 data
diet2012.plot(grid=True)
plt.show()

Merging Time Series With Different Dates
Stock and bond markets in the U.S. are closed on different days. For example, although the bond market is closed on Columbus Day (around Oct 12) and Veterans Day (around Nov 11), the stock market is open on those days. One way to see the dates that the stock market is open and the bond market is closed is to convert both indexes of dates into sets and take the difference in sets.

The pandas .join() method is a convenient tool to merge the stock and bond DataFrames on dates when both markets are open.

Stock prices and 10-year US Government bond yields, which were downloaded from FRED, are pre-loaded in DataFrames stocks and bonds.

Instructions
100 XP
Convert the dates in the stocks.index and bonds.index into sets.
Take the difference of the stock set minus the bond set to get those dates where the stock market has data but the bond market does not.
Merge the two DataFrames into a new DataFrame, stocks_and_bonds using the .join() method, which has the syntax df1.join(df2).
To get the intersection of dates, use the argument how='inner'.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Convert the stock index and bond index into sets
set_stock_dates = set(stocks.index)
set_bond_dates = set(bonds.index)

# Take the difference between the sets and print
print(set_stock_dates - set_bond_dates)

# Merge stocks and bonds DataFrames using join()
stocks_and_bonds = stocks.join(bonds, how='inner')

<script.py> output:
    {'2009-11-11', '2007-11-12', '2015-10-12', '2011-10-10', '2010-11-11', '2012-11-12', '2010-10-11', '2015-11-11', '2007-10-08', '2014-10-13', '2008-11-11', '2016-10-10', '2009-10-12', '2017-06-09', '2011-11-11', '2008-10-13', '2014-11-11', '2013-11-11', '2016-11-11', '2013-10-14', '2012-10-08'}

	Correlation of Stocks and Bonds
Investors are often interested in the correlation between the returns of two different assets for asset allocation and hedging purposes. In this exercise, you'll try to answer the question of whether stocks are positively or negatively correlated with bonds. Scatter plots are also useful for visualizing the correlation between the two variables.

Keep in mind that you should compute the correlations on the percentage changes rather than the levels.

Stock prices and 10-year bond yields are combined in a DataFrame called stocks_and_bonds under columns SP500 and US10Y

The pandas and plotting modules have already been imported for you. For the remainder of the course, pandas is imported as pd and matplotlib.pyplot is imported as plt.

Instructions

Compute percent changes on the stocks_and_bonds DataFrame using the .pct_change() method and call the new DataFrame returns.
Compute the correlation of the columns SP500 and US10Y in the returns DataFrame using the .corr() method for Series which has the syntax series1.corr(series2).
Show a scatter plot of the percentage change in stock and bond yields.


# Compute percent change using pct_change()
returns = stocks_and_bonds.pct_change()

# Compute correlation using corr()
correlation = returns['SP500'].corr(returns['US10Y'])
print("Correlation of stocks and interest rates: ", correlation)

# Make scatter plot
plt.scatter(x=returns.SP500, y=returns.US10Y)
plt.show()

	
<script.py> output:
    Correlation of stocks and interest rates:  0.4119448886249272
		
	The positive correlation means that when interest rates go down, stock prices go down. For example, during crises like 9/11, investors sold stocks and moved their money to less risky bonds (this is sometimes referred to as a 'flight to quality'). During these periods, stocks drop and interest rates drop as well. Of course, there are times when the opposite relationship holds too.

Flying Saucers Aren't Correlated to Flying Markets
Two trending series may show a strong correlation even if they are completely unrelated. This is referred to as "spurious correlation". That's why when you look at the correlation of say, two stocks, you should look at the correlation of their returns and not their levels.

To illustrate this point, calculate the correlation between the levels of the stock market and the annual sightings of UFOs. Both of those time series have trended up over the last several decades, and the correlation of their levels is very high. Then calculate the correlation of their percent changes. This will be close to zero, since there is no relationship between those two series.

The DataFrame levels contains the levels of DJI and UFO. UFO data was downloaded from www.nuforc.org.

Instructions
100 XP
Calculate the correlation of the columns DJI and UFO.
Create a new DataFrame of changes using the .pct_change() method.
Re-calculate the correlation of the columns DJI and UFO on the changes.

# Compute correlation of levels
correlation1 = levels['DJI'].corr(levels['UFO'])
print("Correlation of levels: ", correlation1)

# Compute correlation of percent changes
changes = levels.pct_change()
correlation2 = changes['DJI'].corr(changes['UFO'])
print("Correlation of changes: ", correlation2)

<script.py> output:
    Correlation of levels:  0.9399762210726432
    Correlation of changes:  0.06026935462405376

Great work! Notice that the correlation on levels is high but the correlation on changes is close to zero.

Looking at a Regression's R-Squared
R-squared measures how closely the data fit the regression line, so the R-squared in a simple regression is related to the correlation between the two variables. In particular, the magnitude of the correlation is the square root of the R-squared and the sign of the correlation is the sign of the regression coefficient.

In this exercise, you will start using the statistical package statsmodels, which performs much of the statistical modeling and testing that is found in R and software packages like SAS and MATLAB.

You will take two series, x and y, compute their correlation, and then regress y on x using the function OLS(y,x) in the statsmodels.api library (note that the dependent, or right-hand side variable y is the first argument). Most linear regressions contain a constant term which is the intercept (the α in the regression yt=α+βxt+ϵt). To include a constant using the function OLS(), you need to add a column of 1's to the right hand side of the regression.

The module statsmodels.api has been imported for you as sm.

Compute the correlation between x and y using the .corr() method.
Run a regression:
First convert the Series x to a DataFrame dfx.
Add a constant using sm.add_constant(), assigning it to dfx1
Regress y on dfx1 using sm.OLS().fit().
Print out the results of the regression and compare the R-squared with the correlation.

# Import the statsmodels module
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Compute correlation of x and y
correlation = x.corr(y)
print("The correlation between x and y is %4.2f" %(correlation))

# Convert the Series x to a DataFrame and name the column x
dfx = pd.DataFrame(x, columns=['x'])

# Add a constant to the DataFrame dfx
dfx1 = sm.add_constant(dfx)

# Regress y on dfx1
result = sm.OLS(y, dfx1).fit()

# Print out the results and look at the relationship between R-squared and the correlation above
print(result.summary())


<script.py> output:
    The correlation between x and y is -0.90

A Popular Strategy Using Autocorrelation
One puzzling anomaly with stocks is that investors tend to overreact to news. Following large jumps, either up or down, stock prices tend to reverse. This is described as mean reversion in stock prices: prices tend to bounce back, or revert, towards previous levels after large moves, which are observed over time horizons of about a week. A more mathematical way to describe mean reversion is to say that stock returns are negatively autocorrelated.

This simple idea is actually the basis for a popular hedge fund strategy. If you're curious to learn more about this hedge fund strategy (although it's not necessary reading for anything else later in the course), see here.

You'll look at the autocorrelation of weekly returns of MSFT stock from 2012 to 2017. You'll start with a DataFrame MSFT of daily prices. You should use the .resample() method to get weekly prices and then compute returns from prices. Use the pandas method .autocorr() to get the autocorrelation and show that the autocorrelation is negative. Note that the .autocorr() method only works on Series, not DataFrames (even DataFrames with one column), so you will have to select the column in the DataFrame.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the .resample() method with rule='W' and how='last'to convert daily data to weekly data.
The argument how in .resample() has been deprecated.
The new syntax .resample().last() also works.
Create a new DataFrame, returns, of percent changes in weekly prices using the .pct_change() method.
Compute the autocorrelation using the .autocorr() method on the series of closing stock prices, which is the column 'Adj Close' in the DataFrame returns.

# Convert the daily data to weekly data
MSFT = MSFT.resample(rule='W',how='last')

# Compute the percentage change of prices
returns = MSFT.pct_change()

# Compute and print the autocorrelation of returns
autocorrelation = returns['Adj Close'].autocorr()
print("The autocorrelation of weekly returns is %4.2f" %(autocorrelation))


<script.py> output:
    The autocorrelation of weekly returns is -0.16

Are Interest Rates Autocorrelated?
When you look at daily changes in interest rates, the autocorrelation is close to zero. However, if you resample the data and look at annual changes, the autocorrelation is negative. This implies that while short term changes in interest rates may be uncorrelated, long term changes in interest rates are negatively autocorrelated. A daily move up or down in interest rates is unlikely to tell you anything about interest rates tomorrow, but a move in interest rates over a year can tell you something about where interest rates are going over the next year. And this makes some economic sense: over long horizons, when interest rates go up, the economy tends to slow down, which consequently causes interest rates to fall, and vice versa.

The DataFrame daily_rates contains daily data of 10-year interest rates from 1962 to 2017.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a new DataFrame, daily_diff, of changes in daily rates using the .diff() method.
Compute the autocorrelation of the column 'US10Y' in daily_diff using the .autocorr() method.
Use the .resample() method with arguments rule='A' to convert to annual frequency and how='last'.
The argument how in .resample() has been deprecated.
The new syntax .resample().last() also works.
Create a new DataFrame, yearly_diff of changes in annual rates and compute the autocorrelation, as above.

# Compute the daily change in interest rates
daily_diff = daily_rates.diff()

# Compute and print the autocorrelation of daily changes
autocorrelation_daily = daily_diff['US10Y'].autocorr()
print("The autocorrelation of daily interest rate changes is %4.2f" %(autocorrelation_daily))

# Convert the daily data to annual data
yearly_rates = daily_rates.resample(rule='A').last()

# Repeat above for annual data
yearly_diff = yearly_rates.diff()
autocorrelation_yearly = yearly_diff['US10Y'].autocorr()
print("The autocorrelation of annual interest rate changes is %4.2f" %(autocorrelation_yearly))


<script.py> output:
    The autocorrelation of daily interest rate changes is 0.07
    The autocorrelation of annual interest rate changes is -0.22

Taxing Exercise: Compute the ACF
In the last chapter, you computed autocorrelations with one lag. Often we are interested in seeing the autocorrelation over many lags. The quarterly earnings for H&R Block (ticker symbol HRB) is plotted on the right, and you can see the extreme cyclicality of its earnings. A vast majority of its earnings occurs in the quarter that taxes are due.

You will compute the array of autocorrelations for the H&R Block quarterly earnings that is pre-loaded in the DataFrame HRB. Then, plot the autocorrelation function using the plot_acf module. This plot shows what the autocorrelation function looks like for cyclical earnings data. The ACF at lag=0 is always one, of course. In the next exercise, you will learn about the confidence interval for the ACF, but for now, suppress the confidence interval by setting alpha=1.

Are We Confident This Stock is Mean Reverting?
In the last chapter, you saw that the autocorrelation of MSFT's weekly stock returns was -0.16. That autocorrelation seems large, but is it statistically significant? In other words, can you say that there is less than a 5% chance that we would observe such a large negative autocorrelation if the true autocorrelation were really zero? And are there any autocorrelations at other lags that are significantly different from zero?

Even if the true autocorrelations were zero at all lags, in a finite sample of returns you won't see the estimate of the autocorrelations exactly zero. In fact, the standard deviation of the sample autocorrelation is 1/N−−√ where N is the number of observations, so if N=100, for example, the standard deviation of the ACF is 0.1, and since 95% of a normal curve is between +1.96 and -1.96 standard deviations from the mean, the 95% confidence interval is ±1.96/N−−√. This approximation only holds when the true autocorrelations are all zero.

You will compute the actual and approximate confidence interval for the ACF, and compare it to the lag-one autocorrelation of -0.16 from the last chapter. The weekly returns of Microsoft is pre-loaded in a DataFrame called returns.

    The autocorrelation of weekly MSFT returns is -0.16
    The approximate confidence interval is +/- 0.12
