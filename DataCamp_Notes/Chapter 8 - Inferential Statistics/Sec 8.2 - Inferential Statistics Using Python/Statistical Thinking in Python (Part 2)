Course Description
After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

Parameter estimation by optimization
FREE
0%
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. A probability distribution that describes your data has parameters. So, a major goal of statistical inference is to estimate the values of these parameters, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.

How often do we get no-hitters?
The number of games played between each no-hitter in the modern era (1901-2015) of Major League Baseball is stored in the array nohitter_times.

If you assume that no-hitters are described as a Poisson process, then the time between no-hitters is Exponentially distributed. As you have seen, the Exponential distribution has a single parameter, which we will call τ, the typical interval time. The value of the parameter τ that makes the exponential distribution best match the data is the mean interval time (where time is in units of number of games) between no-hitters.

Compute the value of this parameter from the data. Then, use np.random.exponential() to "repeat" the history of Major League Baseball by drawing inter-no-hitter times from an exponential distribution with the τ you found and plot the histogram as an approximation to the PDF.

NumPy, pandas, matlotlib.pyplot, and seaborn have been imported for you as np, pd, plt, and sns, respectively.

Seed the random number generator with 42.
Compute the mean time (in units of number of games) between no-hitters.
Draw 100,000 samples from an Exponential distribution with the parameter you computed from the mean of the inter-no-hitter times.
Plot the theoretical PDF using plt.hist(). Remember to use keyword arguments bins=50, normed=True, and histtype='step'. Be sure to label your axes.
Show your plot.

# Seed random number generator
np.random.seed(42)

# Compute mean no-hitter time: tau
tau = np.mean(nohitter_times)

# Draw out of an exponential distribution with parameter tau: inter_nohitter_time
inter_nohitter_time = np.random.exponential(tau, 100000)

# Plot the PDF and label axes
_ = plt.hist(inter_nohitter_time,
             bins=50, normed=True, histtype='step')
_ = plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Do the data follow our story?
You have modeled no-hitters using an Exponential distribution. Create an ECDF of the real data. Overlay the theoretical CDF with the ECDF from the data. This helps you to verify that the Exponential distribution describes the observed data.

It may be helpful to remind yourself of the function you created in the previous course to compute the ECDF, as well as the code you wrote to plot it.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute an ECDF from the actual time between no-hitters (nohitter_times). Use the ecdf() function you wrote in the prequel course.
Create a CDF from the theoretical samples you took in the last exercise (inter_nohitter_time).
Plot x_theor and y_theor as a line using plt.plot(). Then overlay the ECDF of the real data x and y as points. To do this, you have to specify the keyword arguments marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x and y inside plt.plot().
Set a 2% margin on the plot.
Show the plot.

# Create an ECDF from real data: x, y
x, y = ecdf(nohitter_times)

# Create a CDF from theoretical samples: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor, y_theor = ecdf(inter_nohitter_time)

# Overlay the plots
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)
plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Margins and axis labels
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


It looks like no-hitters in the modern era of Major League Baseball are Exponentially distributed. Based on the story of the Exponential distribution, this suggests that they are a random process; when a no-hitter will happen is independent of when the last no-hitter was.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


How is this parameter optimal?
Now sample out of an exponential distribution with τ being twice as large as the optimal τ. Do it again for τ half as large. Make CDFs of these samples and overlay them with your data. You can see that they do not reproduce the data as well. Thus, the τ you computed from the mean inter-no-hitter times is optimal in that it best reproduces the data.

Note: In this and all subsequent exercises, the random number generator is pre-seeded for you to save you some typing.

Instructions
100 XP
Take 10000 samples out of an Exponential distribution with parameter τ1/2 = tau/2.

EDA of literacy/fertility data
In the next few exercises, we will look at the correlation between female literacy and fertility (defined as the average number of children born per woman) throughout the world. For ease of analysis and interpretation, we will work with the illiteracy rate.

It is always a good idea to do some EDA ahead of our analysis. To this end, plot the fertility versus illiteracy and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Numpy array illiteracy has the illiteracy rate among females for most of the world's nations. The array fertility has the corresponding fertility data.

Here, it may be useful to refer back to the function you wrote in the previous course to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Instructions
100 XP
Plot fertility (y-axis) versus illiteracy (x-axis) as a scatter plot.
Set a 2% margin.
Compute and print the Pearson correlation coefficient between illiteracy and fertility.



# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(fertility, illiteracy, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set the margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Show the Pearson correlation coefficient
print(pearson_r(fertility, illiteracy))


<script.py> output:
    0.804132402682
		

You can see the correlation between illiteracy and fertility by eye, and by the substantial Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8. It is difficult to resolve in the scatter plot, but there are many points around near-zero illiteracy and about 1.8 children/woman.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Linear regression
We will assume that fertility is a linear function of the female illiteracy rate. That is, f=ai+b, where a is the slope and b is the intercept. We can think of the intercept as the minimal fertility rate, probably somewhere between one and two. The slope tells us how the fertility rate varies with illiteracy. We can find the best fit line using np.polyfit().

Plot the data and the best fit line. Print out the slope and intercept. (Think: what are their units?)

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the slope and intercept of the regression line using np.polyfit(). Remember, fertility is on the y-axis and illiteracy on the x-axis.
Print out the slope and intercept from the linear regression.
To plot the best fit line, create an array x that consists of 0 and 100 using np.array(). Then, compute the theoretical values of y based on your regression parameters. I.e., y = a * x + b.
Plot the data and the regression line on the same plot. Be sure to label your axes.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to display your plot.


# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy, fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')

# Perform a linear regression using np.polyfit(): a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(illiteracy, fertility, deg=1)

# Print the results to the screen
print('slope =', a, 'children per woman / percent illiterate')
print('intercept =', b, 'children per woman')

# Make theoretical line to plot
x = np.array([0,100])
y = a * x + b

# Add regression line to your plot
_ = plt.plot(x, y)

# Draw the plot
plt.show()


<script.py> output:
    slope = 0.0497985480906 children per woman / percent illiterate
    intercept = 1.88805061064 children per woman

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

How is it optimal?
The function np.polyfit() that you used to get your regression parameters finds the optimal slope and intercept. It is optimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, also known as RSS (for residual sum of squares). In this exercise, you will plot the function that is being optimized, the RSS, versus the slope parameter a. To do this, fix the intercept to be what you found in the optimization. Then, plot the RSS vs. the slope. Where is it minimal?

Instructions
100 XP
Specify the values of the slope to compute the RSS. Use np.linspace() to get 200 points in the range between 0 and 0.1. For example, to get 100 points in the range between 0 and 0.5, you could use np.linspace() like so: np.linspace(0, 0.5, 100).
Initialize an array, rss, to contain the RSS using np.empty_like() and the array you created above. The empty_like() function returns a new array with the same shape and type as a given array (in this case, a_vals).
Write a for loop to compute the sum of RSS of the slope. Hint: the RSS is given by np.sum((y_data - a * x_data - b)**2). The variable b you computed in the last exercise is already in your namespace. Here, fertility is the y_data and illiteracy the x_data.
Plot the RSS (rss) versus slope (a_vals).
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Specify slopes to consider: a_vals
a_vals = np.linspace(0,0.1,200)

# Initialize sum of square of residuals: rss
rss = np.empty_like(a_vals)

# Compute sum of square of residuals for each value of a_vals
for i, a in enumerate(a_vals):
    rss[i] = np.sum((fertility - a*illiteracy - b)**2)

# Plot the RSS
plt.plot(a_vals, rss, '-')
plt.xlabel('slope (children per woman / percent illiterate)')
plt.ylabel('sum of square of residuals')

plt.show()


Great work! Notice that the minimum on the plot, that is the value of the slope that gives the minimum sum of the square of the residuals, is the same value you got when performing the regression

Linear regression on appropriate Anscombe data
For practice, perform a linear regression on the data set from Anscombe's quartet that is most reasonably interpreted with linear regression.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the parameters for the slope and intercept using np.polyfit(). The Anscombe data are stored in the arrays x and y.
Print the slope a and intercept b.
Generate theoretical x and y data from the linear regression. Your x array, which you can create with np.array(), should consist of 3 and 15. To generate the y data, multiply the slope by x_theor and add the intercept.
Plot the Anscombe data as a scatter plot and then plot the theoretical line. Remember to include the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments in addition to x and y when to plot the Anscombe data as a scatter plot. You do not need these arguments when plotting the theoretical line.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!

# Perform linear regression: a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,deg=1)

# Print the slope and intercept
print(a, b)

# Generate theoretical x and y data: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor = np.array([3, 15])
y_theor = x_theor * a + b

# Plot the Anscombe data and theoretical line
_ = plt.plot(x,y,marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_theor,y_theor,marker='.', linestyle='none')

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Linear regression on all Anscombe data
Now, to verify that all four of the Anscombe data sets have the same slope and intercept from a linear regression, you will compute the slope and intercept for each set. The data are stored in lists; anscombe_x = [x1, x2, x3, x4] and anscombe_y = [y1, y2, y3, y4], where, for example, x2 and y2 are the x and y values for the second Anscombe data set.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a for loop to do the following for each Anscombe data set.
Compute the slope and intercept.
Print the slope and intercept.

# Iterate through x,y pairs
for x, y in zip(anscombe_x, anscombe_y):
    # Compute the slope and intercept: a, b
    a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,deg=1)

    # Print the result
    print('slope:', a, 'intercept:', b)

Bootstrap confidence intervals
0%
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.



Bootstrapping
● The use of resampled data to
perform statistical inference


Bootstrap sample
● A resampled array of the data

Bootstrap replicate
● A statistic computed from a resampled array


Resampling engine: np.random.choice()
In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: np.random.choice([1,2,3,4,5], size=5)
Out[2]: array([5, 3, 5, 5, 2])



Computing a bootstrap replicate
In [1]: bs_sample = np.random.choice(michelson_speed_of_light,
 ...: size=100)
In [2]: np.mean(bs_sample)
Out[2]: 299847.79999999999
In [3]: np.median(bs_sample)
Out[3]: 299845.0
In [4]: np.std(bs_sample)
Out[4]: 83.564286025729331


Getting the terminology down
Getting tripped up over terminology is a common cause of frustration in students. Unfortunately, you often will read and hear other data scientists using different terminology for bootstrap samples and replicates. This is even more reason why we need everything to be clear and consistent for this course. So, before going forward discussing bootstrapping, let's get our terminology down. If we have a data set with n repeated measurements, a bootstrap sample is an array of length n that was drawn from the original data with replacement. What is a bootstrap replicate?

A single value of a statistic computed from a bootstrap sample.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Bootstrapping by hand
To help you gain intuition about how bootstrapping works, imagine you have a data set that has only three points, [-1, 0, 1]. How many unique bootstrap samples can be drawn (e.g., [-1, 0, 1] and [1, 0, -1] are unique), and what is the maximum mean you can get from a bootstrap sample? It might be useful to jot down the samples on a piece of paper.

(These are too few data to get meaningful results from bootstrap procedures, but this example is useful for intuition.)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Visualizing bootstrap samples
In this exercise, you will generate bootstrap samples from the set of annual rainfall data measured at the Sheffield Weather Station in the UK from 1883 to 2015. The data are stored in the NumPy array rainfall in units of millimeters (mm). By graphically displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF, you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.
Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).
Use the function ecdf() that you wrote in the prequel to this course to generate the x and y values for the ECDF of the bootstrap sample bs_sample.
Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Use ecdf() to generate x and y values for the ECDF of the original rainfall data available in the array rainfall.
Plot the ECDF values of the original data.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the samples!

for _ in range(50):
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))

    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)

# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')

# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Generating many bootstrap replicates
The function bootstrap_replicate_1d() from the video is available in your namespace. Now you'll write another function, draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1), which generates many bootstrap replicates from the data set. This function will come in handy for you again and again as you compute confidence intervals and later when you do hypothesis tests.

For your reference, the bootstrap_replicate_1d() function is provided below:

def bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func):
    return func(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data)))
Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1).
Using np.empty(), initialize an array called bs_replicates of size size to hold all of the bootstrap replicates.
Write a for loop that ranges over size and computes a replicate using bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Refer to the exercise description above to see the function signature of bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Store the replicate in the appropriate index of bs_replicates.
Return the array of replicates bs_replicates. This has already been done for you.


def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    """Draw bootstrap replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_replicates[i] =  bootstrap_replicate_1d(data,func)  

    return bs_replicates

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Bootstrap replicates of the mean and the SEM
In this exercise, you will compute a bootstrap estimate of the probability density function of the mean annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station. Remember, we are estimating the mean annual rainfall we would get if the Sheffield Weather Station could repeat all of the measurements from 1883 to 2015 over and over again. This is a probabilistic estimate of the mean. You will plot the PDF as a histogram, and you will see that it is Normal.

In fact, it can be shown theoretically that under not-too-restrictive conditions, the value of the mean will always be Normally distributed. (This does not hold in general, just for the mean and a few other statistics.) The standard deviation of this distribution, called the standard error of the mean, or SEM, is given by the standard deviation of the data divided by the square root of the number of data points. I.e., for a data set, sem = np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)). Using hacker statistics, you get this same result without the need to derive it, but you will verify this result from your bootstrap replicates.

The dataset has been pre-loaded for you into an array called rainfall.

Instructions

Instructions

Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the mean annual rainfall using your draw_bs_reps() function and the rainfall array. Hint: Pass in np.mean for func to compute the mean.
As a reminder, draw_bs_reps() accepts 3 arguments: data, func, and size.
Compute and print the standard error of the mean of rainfall.
The formula to compute this is np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)).
Compute and print the standard deviation of your bootstrap replicates bs_replicates.
Make a histogram of the replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute and print SEM
sem = np.std(rainfall) / np.sqrt(len(rainfall))
print(sem)

# Compute and print standard deviation of bootstrap replicates
bs_std = np.std(bs_replicates)
print(bs_std)

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('mean annual rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


Great work! Notice that the SEM we got from the known expression and the bootstrap replicates is the same and the distribution of the bootstrap replicates of the mean is Normal.


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Confidence intervals of rainfall data
A confidence interval gives upper and lower bounds on the range of parameter values you might expect to get if we repeat our measurements. For named distributions, you can compute them analytically or look them up, but one of the many beautiful properties of the bootstrap method is that you can take percentiles of your bootstrap replicates to get your confidence interval. Conveniently, you can use the np.percentile() function.

Use the bootstrap replicates you just generated to compute the 95% confidence interval. That is, give the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of your bootstrap replicates stored as bs_replicates. What is the 95% confidence interval?


In [1]: np.percentile(bs_replicates, 97.5)
Out[1]: 820.95043233082697

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Bootstrap replicates of other statistics
We saw in a previous exercise that the mean is Normally distributed. This does not necessarily hold for other statistics, but no worry: as hackers, we can always take bootstrap replicates! In this exercise, you'll generate bootstrap replicates for the variance of the annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station and plot the histogram of the replicates.

Here, you will make use of the draw_bs_reps() function you defined a few exercises ago. It is provided below for your reference:

def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    return np.array([bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func) for _ in range(size)])
Instructions
100 XP
Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the variance in annual rainfall, stored in the rainfall dataset, using your draw_bs_reps() function. Hint: Pass in np.var for computing the variance.
Divide your variance replicates (bs_replicates) by 100 to put the variance in units of square centimeters for convenience.
Make a histogram of bs_replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.

# Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the variance: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall, np.var,size=10000)

# Put the variance in units of square centimeters
bs_replicates = bs_replicates/100

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('variance of annual rainfall (sq. cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Great work! This is not normally distributed, as it has a longer tail to the right. Note that you can also compute a confidence interval on the variance, or any other statistic, using np.percentile() with your bootstrap replicates.

Confidence interval on the rate of no-hitters
Consider again the inter-no-hitter intervals for the modern era of baseball. Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the optimal parameter τ. Plot a histogram of your replicates and report a 95% confidence interval.

Instructions
100 XP
Generate 10000 bootstrap replicates of τ from the nohitter_times data using your draw_bs_reps() function. Recall that the the optimal τ is calculated as the mean of the data.
Compute the 95% confidence interval using np.percentile() and passing in two arguments: The array bs_replicates, and the list of percentiles - in this case 2.5 and 97.5.
Print the confidence interval.
Plot a histogram of your bootstrap replicates. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates,[2.5,97.5])

# Print the confidence interval
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games')

# Plot the histogram of the replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel(r'$\tau$ (games)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


This gives you an estimate of what the typical time between no-hitters is. It could be anywhere between 660 and 870 games.

A function to do pairs bootstrap
As discussed in the video, pairs bootstrap involves resampling pairs of data. Each collection of pairs fit with a line, in this case using np.polyfit(). We do this again and again, getting bootstrap replicates of the parameter values. To have a useful tool for doing pairs bootstrap, you will write a function to perform pairs bootstrap on a set of x,y data.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1) to perform pairs bootstrap estimates on linear regression parameters.
Use np.arange() to set up an array of indices going from 0 to len(x). These are what you will resample and use them to pick values out of the x and y arrays.
Use np.empty() to initialize the slope and intercept replicate arrays to be of size size.
Write a for loop to:
Resample the indices inds. Use np.random.choice() to do this.
Make new x and y arrays bs_x and bs_y using the the resampled indices bs_inds. To do this, slice x and y with bs_inds.
Use np.polyfit() on the new x and y arrays and store the computed slope and intercept.
Return the pair bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept.


def draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for linear regression."""

    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))

    # Initialize replicates: bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
    bs_slope_reps = np.empty(size)
    bs_intercept_reps = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, size=len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[bs_inds], y[bs_inds]
        bs_slope_reps[i], bs_intercept_reps[i] = np.polyfit(bs_x,bs_y,1)

    return bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps

Pairs bootstrap of literacy/fertility data
Using the function you just wrote, perform pairs bootstrap to plot a histogram describing the estimate of the slope from the illiteracy/fertility data. Also report the 95% confidence interval of the slope. The data is available to you in the NumPy arrays illiteracy and fertility.

As a reminder, draw_bs_pairs_linreg() has a function signature of draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1), and it returns two values: bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps.

Instructions
100 XP
Use your draw_bs_pairs_linreg() function to take 1000 bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept. The x-axis data is illiteracy and y-axis data is fertility.
Compute and print the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the slope.
Plot and show a histogram of the slope replicates. Be sure to label your axes. This has been done for you, so click 'Submit Answer' to see your histogram!


# Generate replicates of slope and intercept using pairs bootstrap
bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps = draw_bs_pairs_linreg(illiteracy, fertility, size=1000)

# Compute and print 95% CI for slope
print(np.percentile(bs_slope_reps, [2.5,97.5]))

# Plot the histogram
_ = plt.hist(bs_slope_reps, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('slope')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()


<script.py> output:
    [ 0.04378061  0.0551616 ]

    Plotting bootstrap regressions
A nice way to visualize the variability we might expect in a linear regression is to plot the line you would get from each bootstrap replicate of the slope and intercept. Do this for the first 100 of your bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept (stored as bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps).

Instructions
100 XP
Generate an array of x-values consisting of 0 and 100 for the plot of the regression lines. Use the np.array() function for this.
Write a for loop in which you plot a regression line with a slope and intercept given by the pairs bootstrap replicates. Do this for 100 lines.
When plotting the regression lines in each iteration of the for loop, recall the regression equation y = a*x + b. Here, a is bs_slope_reps[i] and b is bs_intercept_reps[i].
Specify the keyword arguments linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, and color='red' in your call to plt.plot().
Make a scatter plot with illiteracy on the x-axis and fertility on the y-axis. Remember to specify the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Label the axes, set a 2% margin, and show the plot. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the bootstrap regressions!

# Generate array of x-values for bootstrap lines: x
x = np.array([0, 100])

# Plot the bootstrap lines
for i in range(100):
    _ = plt.plot(x, 
                 bs_slope_reps[i] * x + bs_intercept_reps[i],
                 linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, color='red')

# Plot the data
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy, fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Label axes, set the margins, and show the plot
_ = plt.xlabel('illiteracy')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()

Introduction to hypothesis testing

You now know how to define and estimate parameters given a model. But the question remains: how reasonable is it to observe your data if a model is true? This question is addressed by hypothesis tests. They are the icing on the inference cake. After completing this chapter, you will be able to carefully construct and test hypotheses using hacker statistics.

Hypothesis testing - Assessment of how reasonable the observed data
are assuming a hypothesis is true

Null hypothesis - ● Another name for the hypothesis you are testing


Permutation ● Random reordering of entries in an array


Generating a permutation sample
In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: dem_share_both = np.concatenate(
 ...: (dem_share_PA, dem_share_OH))
In [3]: dem_share_perm = np.random.permutation(dem_share_both)
In [4]: perm_sample_PA = dem_share_perm[:len(dem_share_PA)]
In [5]: perm_sample_OH = dem_share_perm[len(dem_share_PA):]

Hypothesis test examples

As you saw from the last chapter, hypothesis testing can be a bit tricky. You need to define the null hypothesis, figure out how to simulate it, and define clearly what it means to be "more extreme" in order to compute the p-value. Like any skill, practice makes perfect, and this chapter gives you some good practice with hypothesis tests.

Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!
