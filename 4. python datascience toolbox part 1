Course Description
It's now time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are lots and lots of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a Data Scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. On top of this, you'll wrap up each Chapter by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts.


--------------------------------WRITING YOR OWN FUNCTIONS---------------------------------------------------------
_______________________________User Defined Functions______________________________________________________________________

In this vourse will learn how to do the following:
1) Defined functions without parameters
2) Defined functions with one parameter
3) Define functions that return a value

In later sectons, will leanr how to defined functions with multiple arguments and functions tha return multiple values


Built-in functions
  - Let's check out python's built in function str, which accepts an object such as a number and return a string object
          x = str(5)
          print(x)
          print(type(x))
          
          ### You can assign a str to a variable to store its return value

Defining a function
        We'll see how to define functions via an example, a funtion that squares a number
        To define the function we begin with the keyword def followed by the function's name
        
        def square():   ### <-- functuon header
                new_value = 4 ** 2
                print(new_value)   ###<-- function body (indented)
                
                
        def square(value):   ### <-- functuon header -- Number here is parameter
                new_value = value ** 2
                print(new_value)   ###<-- function body (indented) 
                
        square(4)               ####< Number here is an argument        
        
        
        
   What if we don't want to print it but want to return it directly? 
   You can have your function return the new value by adding the return ketword followed by the value to return
   
          def square(value):
                  new_value = value ** 2
                  return new_v
                  
                  
Another essential aspect of writing functions in Oython: docstrings
-Describes what your function does, such as the computations it performs or its return values
-These descriptions serve as documentation for your functions so that anyone who reads yur funtions's docstrings understand what your funtion does without having to trace through all the code in the function definition
-Placed in the immediate line after the function headr
-In btween triple double quotes """

ex: 
        
       def square(value):
              """Return the square of a value."""
              new_value = value ** 2
              return new_value
              
              
              
                  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Strings in Python
In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype, strings. Recall that these represent textual data. To assign the string 'DataCamp' to a variable company, you execute:

company = 'DataCamp'
You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings. Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:

object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
object2 = 1 * 3
object3 = "1" * 3
What are the values in object1, object2, and object3, respectively?


     Recapping built-in functions
In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in functions print() and str(). Here, you will use both functions and examine their return values. A variable x has been preloaded for this exercise. Run the code below in the console. Pay close attention to the results to answer the question that follows.

Assign str(x) to a variable y1: y1 = str(x)
Assign print(x) to a variable y2: y2 = print(x)
Check the types of the variables x, y1, and y2.
What are the types of x, y1, and y2?             
                  
                  
                  
                  
  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
  Write a simple function
In the last video, Hugo described the basics of how to define a function. You will now write your own function!

Define a function, shout(), which simply prints out a string with three exclamation marks '!!!' at the end. The code for the square() function that we wrote earlier is found below. You can use it as a pattern to define shout().

def square():
    new_value = 4 ** 2
    return new_value
Note that the function body is indented 4 spaces already for you. Function bodies need to be indented by a consistent number of spaces and the choice of 4 is common.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Code Snippet:
# Define the function shout
def shout():
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = 'congratulations'+'!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout
shout()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single-parameter functions
Congratulations! You have successfully defined and called your own function! That's pretty cool.

In the previous exercise, you defined and called the function shout(), which printed out a string concatenated with '!!!'. You will now update shout() by adding a parameter so that it can accept and process any string argument passed to it. Also note that shout(word), the part of the header that specifies the function name and parameter(s), is known as the signature of the function. You may encounter this term in the wild!

Complete the function header by adding the parameter name, word.
Assign the result of concatenating word with '!!!' to shout_word.
Print the value of shout_word.
Call the shout() function, passing to it the string, 'congratulations'.

# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout with the string 'congratulations'
shout('congratulations')



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions that return single values
You're getting very good at this! Try your hand at another modification to the shout() function so that it now returns a single value instead of printing within the function. Recall that the return keyword lets you return values from functions. Parts of the function shout(), which you wrote earlier, are shown. Returning values is generally more desirable than printing them out because, as you saw earlier, a print() call assigned to a variable has type NoneType.


In the function body, concatenate the string in word with '!!!' and assign to shout_word.
Replace the print() statement with the appropriate return statement.
Call the shout() function, passing to it the string, 'congratulations', and assigning the call to the variable, yell.
To check if yell contains the value returned by shout(), print the value of yell.

>>>>>>>>>>> 
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Return a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Replace print with return
    return(shout_word)

# Pass 'congratulations' to shout: yell
yell = shout('congratulations')

# Print yell
print(yell)

                  
  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  
    Multiple Function Parameters
    
                  
   -Accept more than 1 parameter
   
                ex:    def raise_to_power(value1, value2):
                              """Raise value1 to the power of value2."""
                              new_value = value1 ** value2
                              return new_value
                              
  Make sure to change function name and docs strings to reflect new behavior
  
  Call function: # pf arguments  = # of parameters
          -The order in which the arguments are passed correpsond to the order of the parameters in the function header
         
  You can also make your function return multiple values
  You do that by constructing objects known as tuples in your functions
  
  A quick jump into tuples
          - Make functions return multiple values
          -Tupes:
                  -Like a list - can contain multple values
                  Immutable - can;t modufy values
                  Constucted using parentheses()
                  
                  ex: 
                  even_nums = (2,4,6)
                  print(type(even_nums))
                
         
         
  Unpacking tuples
          -Unpack tuple into several variables
          
          even_nums = (2,4,6)
          a,b,c = even_nums
          print(a)
          print(b)
          
    
    
Accessing tuple elements
-Accessing tuple elements like you do with lists:
        
        ex: 
                even_nums = (2,4,6)
                print(even_nums[1])
                second_num = even_nums[1]
  -Uses zero indexing               
                
                
  
                  
   Let's now modify the prior example
   
   
   def raise_both(value1, value2):
   """Raise value1 to the power of value2 and vice versa"""
   
   new_value1 = value1 ** value2
   new_value2 = value2 ** value1
   
   new_tuple = (new_value1, new_value2)
   
   return new_tuple
   
   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    Functions with multiple parameters
Hugo discussed the use of multiple parameters in defining functions in the last lecture. You are now going to use what you've learned to modify the shout() function further. Here, you will modify shout() to accept two arguments. Parts of the function shout(), which you wrote earlier, are shown.


   Modify the function header such that it accepts two parameters, word1 and word2, in that order.
Concatenate each of word1 and word2 with '!!!' and assign to shout1 and shout2, respectively.
Concatenate shout1 and shout2 together, in that order, and assign to new_shout.
Pass the strings 'congratulations' and 'you', in that order, to a call to shout(). Assign the return value to yell.

# Define shout with parameters word1 and word2
def shout(word1, word2):
    """Concatenate strings with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate shout1 with shout2: new_shout
    new_shout = shout1 + shout2

    # Return new_shout
    return new_shout

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout(): yell
yell = shout('congratulations','you')

# Print yell
print(yell)

                  
                  
 __________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                 
   A brief introduction to tuples
Alongside learning about functions, you've also learned about tuples! Here, you will practice what you've learned about tuples: how to construct, unpack, and access tuple elements. Recall how Hugo unpacked the tuple even_nums in the video:

a, b, c = even_nums

A three-element tuple named nums has been preloaded for this exercise. Before completing the script, perform the following:

Print out the value of nums in the IPython shell. Note the elements in the tuple.
In the IPython shell, try to change the first element of nums to the value 2 by doing an assignment: nums[0] = 2. What happens?
INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Unpack nums to the variables num1, num2, and num3.
Construct a new tuple, even_nums composed of the same elements in nums, but with the 1st element replaced with the value, 2.

# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3
num1, num2, num3 = nums

# Construct even_nums
even_nums=(2, num2, num3)


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Functions that return multiple values
In the previous exercise, you constructed tuples, assigned tuples to variables, and unpacked tuples. Here you will return multiple values from a function using tuples. Let's now update our shout() function to return multiple values. Instead of returning just one string, we will return two strings with the string !!! concatenated to each.

Note that the return statement return x, y has the same result as return (x, y): the former actually packs x and y into a tuple under the hood!

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Modify the function header such that the function name is now shout_all, and it accepts two parameters, word1 and word2, in that order.
Concatenate the string '!!!' to each of word1 and word2 and assign to shout1 and shout2, respectively.
Construct a tuple shout_words, composed of shout1 and shout2.
Call shout_all() with the strings 'congratulations' and 'you' and assign the result to yell1 and yell2 (remember, shout_all() returns 2 variables!).


# Define shout_all with parameters word1 and word2
def shout_all(word1, word2):
    
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Construct a tuple with shout1 and shout2: shout_words
    shout_words = (shout1,shout2)

    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout_all(): yell1, yell2
yell1, yell2 = shout_all('congratulations','you')

# Print yell1 and yell2
print(yell1)
print(yell2)

You've Leared:
-How to write functions 
        -Accept multiple parameters
        -Return multiple values
        
-Up next: Functions for analyzing Twitter data
      -Functiom you write will return a dictinary containing data of how many times each language was used across al tweets in the DataFrame
      -Later on in the course we'll see we can write generalized fntions to count occurrences of any items in a DataFrame column. 


   Let's now recap the basic ingredients of a function
   -
                  
                  
                  
     _________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     Bringing it all together (1)
You've got your first taste of writing your own functions in the previous exercises. You've learned how to add parameters to your own function definitions, return a value or multiple values with tuples, and how to call the functions you've defined.

In this and the following exercise, you will bring together all these concepts and apply them to a simple data science problem. You will load a dataset and develop functionalities to extract simple insights from the data.

For this exercise, your goal is to recall how to load a dataset into a DataFrame. The dataset contains Twitter data and you will iterate over entries in a column to build a dictionary in which the keys are the names of languages and the values are the number of tweets in the given language. The file tweets.csv is available in your current directory.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import the pandas package with the alias pd.
Import the file 'tweets.csv' using the pandas function read_csv(). Assign the resulting DataFrame to df.
Complete the for loop by iterating over col, the 'lang' column in the DataFrame df.
Complete the bodies of the if-else statements in the for loop: if the key is in the dictionary langs_count, add 1 to its current value, else add the key to langs_count and set its value to 1. Use the loop variable entry in your code.
                  
                  

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')

# Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
langs_count = {}

# Extract column from DataFrame: col
col = df['lang']

# Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
for entry in col:

    # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
    if entry in langs_count.keys():
        langs_count[entry] += 1
    # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
    else:
        langs_count[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)


__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  Bringing it all together (2)
Great job! You've now defined the functionality for iterating over entries in a column and building a dictionary with keys the names of languages and values the number of tweets in the given language.

In this exercise, you will define a function with the functionality you developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from within the function, and call the function with the appropriate arguments.

For your convenience, the pandas package has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the tweets_df variable.

Define the function count_entries(), which has two parameters. The first parameter is df for the DataFrame and the second is col_name for the column name.
Complete the bodies of the if-else statements in the for loop: if the key is in the dictionary langs_count, add 1 to its current value, else add the key to langs_count and set its value to 1. Use the loop variable entry in your code.
Return the langs_count dictionary from inside the count_entries() function.
Call the count_entries() function by passing to it tweets_df and the name of the column, 'lang'. Assign the result of the call to the variable result.



# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry] += 1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count

# Call count_entries(): result
result = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)

Topic: Scope and User-Defined Functions

Crash Course on Scope in Functions

        - Idea of scope in the context of user-defined functions
        - Not all objects are accessible everywhere in a script
        - Scope - part of the program where an object or name may be accessible
                -Names refer to the variables or, more generally, objects such as functions that are defined in your program, for example, a variable X has a name as does the function sum. 
                
        -There are three types of scopes that you should know - 
                1) Global Scope - defined in the main body of a script or a python program
                2) Local Scope -defined inside of a function; once the execution of a function is done, any name inside the local scope ceases to exist, which means you cannot access those names anymore outside of the function definition
                3) Built-in Scope - names in the pre-defined built-ins module (such as print, sum)
                  
        
            
        Global vs Local Scope - Example 1:
        
                    new_val = 10
                    
                    def square(value):
                            """Returns the square of a number."""
                            new_val = value ** 2
                            return new_val
                            
                            
                    ### Anytime we call the name in the global scope, it will access the name in the global, as you see here
                    Anytime we call the name in the local scope of the function, it will look first in the local scope
                    If Python cannot find the name in the local scope, it will then and only then look in the global scope
                    
        
   
   
   
        Global vs Local Scope - Example 2:
        
                    new_val = 10
                    
                    def square(value):
                            """Returns the square of a number."""
                            new_val2 = new_value ** 2
                            return new_val2
                            
                            
                    ### Here for example we access new_val defined globally within the function square 
                    Note that the global value accessed is the value at the time the function is called, not the value when the function is defined
                    Thus if we re-assign new_val and call the function square, we see that the new value of new_val is accessed
                    
                    To recap, when we reference a name, first the local scope is searched and then the global
                    If the name is in neither then the built-in scope is searched
                    
                    
        What if we want to alter the value of a global name within a function call? - This is where the keyword global comes in handy. 
        Global vs. Local Scope - Example 3
        
                       
   
                new_val = 10
                
                def square(val):
                        """Returns the square of a number."""
                        global new_val                                            ###Keyword global followed by the name of the global variable we wish to access and alter
                        new_val = new_val ** 2                                   ### Example: We changed new_val 
                        return new_val
                        
                        
   
   
   
   
   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The keyword global
Let's work more on your mastery of scope. In this exercise, you will use the keyword global within a function to alter the value of a variable defined in the global scope.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use the keyword global to alter the object team in the global scope.
Change the value of team in the global scope to the string "justice league". Assign the result to team.
Hit the Submit button to see how executing your newly defined function change_team() changes the value of the name team!

 Python's built-in scope
Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really just a built-in module called builtins. However, to query builtins, you'll need to import builtins 'because the name builtins is not itself built in...No, I’m serious!' (Learning Python, 5th edition, Mark Lutz). After executing import builtins in the IPython Shell, execute dir(builtins) to print a list of all the names in the module builtins. Have a look and you'll see a bunch of names that you'll recognize! Which of the following names is NOT in the module builtins?

Nested Functions
   
   
What if we have a function inner defined within another function outer and we reference a name x in the inner function?
The answer is intuitive: Python searches the local scope of the function inner then if it doesn't find x it searches the scope of the function outer, which is called an enclosing function because it encloses the function inner
If Python can't find x in the scope of the enclosing function it only then searches the global scope and then the built-in scope. 


def outer(...):
      """..."""
      x = ...
      
      def inner(...):
              """..."""
              y= x ** 2
              
      return ...
      
      
   But whoa, hold on there for a second, why are we even nesting functions? 
   There are a number of good reasnons to do so. Let's say that we want to use a process a number of times within a function. 
   
   For example, we want a function that takes 3 numbers as parameters and performs the same function on each of them. 
   One way would be to write out the computation three times but this is unscaleable.  
   
          def mod2plus5(x1, x2, x3):
                  """Returns the remainder plus 5 of three values"""
                  
                  new_x1 = x1 % 2 + 5
                  new_x2 = x2 % 2 + 5
                  new_x3 = x3 % 2 + 5
                  
                  return( new_x1, new_x2, new_x3)
   
   
   
   
   
   What we can do instead is define an inner function within our function definition and call it where necessary as we do here:
   This is called a nested function, the syntax for the inner function is exactly the same as that for any other function.
   
  
   def mod2plus5(x1, x2, x3):
          """Returns the remainder plus 5 of three values."""
          
          def inner(x):
                  """Returns the remainder plus 5 of a value."""
                  return x % 2 + 5
                  
          return( inner(x1), inner(x2), inner(x3))        
   
   
Returning Functions
        - Another important use case of nested functions
                - We define a function, raise_vals, which contains an inner function
  

               def raise_val(n):
                      """Return the inner function."""
                      
                      def inner(x):
                      """Raise x to the power of n."""
                              raised = x ** n
                              return raised
                              
                       return inner       
                  
                  
 Using nonlocal
 =Reall that in our disucssions about scope you can use the keyword global in function definitions to creat and change global names; similarly, in a nested function you can use the keyword nonlocal to create and change names in an enclosing scope
 
        def outer():
                """Prints the value of n."""
                n=1
                
                def inner():
                        nonlocal n   ###In this example we alter the value of n in the inner function; because we used the keyword nonlocal, it also alters the value of n in the enclosing scope
                        n = 2
                        print(n)
                        
                inner()
                print(n)
                  
                  
 - This is why calling the function outer prints the value of n as detrmined within the function inner
 
 
 To summarize:
 name references search at most 4 scopes,
 -the local scope
 -then those of enclosing functions
 -then global
 -then built in
 
 LEGB rule!
 Also remember that assigning names will only create or hange local names, unless they are declared in global or nonlocal statements using the keyword global or the keyword nonlocal, respectively

Nested Functions I
You've learned in the last video about nesting functions within functions. One reason why you'd like to do this is to avoid writing out the same computations within functions repeatedly. There's nothing new about defining nested functions: you simply define it as you would a regular function with def and embed it inside another function!

In this exercise, inside a function three_shouts(), you will define a nested function inner() that concatenates a string object with !!!. three_shouts() then returns a tuple of three elements, each a string concatenated with !!! using inner(). Go for it!

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Complete the function header of the nested function with the function name inner() and a single parameter word.
Complete the return value: each element of the tuple should be a call to inner(), passing in the parameters from three_shouts() as arguments to each call.
     
     
     
   # Define three_shouts
def three_shouts(word1, word2, word3):
    """Returns a tuple of strings
    concatenated with '!!!'."""

    # Define inner
    def inner(word):
        """Returns a string concatenated with '!!!'."""
        return word + '!!!'

    # Return a tuple of strings
    return (inner(word1),inner(word2), inner(word3))

# Call three_shouts() and print
print(three_shouts('a', 'b', 'c'))

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Nested Functions II
Great job, you've just nested a function within another function. One other pretty cool reason for nesting functions is the idea of a closure. This means that the nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. Thus, anything defined locally in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution.

Let's move forward then! In this exercise, you will complete the definition of the inner function inner_echo() and then call echo() a couple of times, each with a different argument. Complete the exercise and see what the output will be!

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Complete the function header of the inner function with the function name inner_echo() and a single parameter word1.
Complete the function echo() so that it returns inner_echo.
We have called echo(), passing 2 as an argument, and assigned the resulting function to twice. Your job is to call echo(), passing 3 as an argument. Assign the resulting function to thrice.
Hit Submit to call twice() and thrice() and print the results.



# Define echo
def echo(n):
    """Return the inner_echo function."""

    # Define inner_echo
    def inner_echo(word1):
        """Concatenate n copies of word1."""
        echo_word = word1 * n
        return echo_word

    # Return inner_echo
    return inner_echo

# Call echo: twice
twice = echo(2)

# Call echo: thrice
thrice = echo(3)

# Call twice() and thrice() then print
print(twice('hello'), thrice('hello'))

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


The keyword nonlocal and nested functions
Let's once again work further on your mastery of scope! In this exercise, you will use the keyword nonlocal within a nested function to alter the value of a variable defined in the enclosing scope.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Assign to echo_word the string word, concatenated with itself.
Use the keyword nonlocal to alter the value of echo_word in the enclosing scope.
Alter echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'.
Call the function echo_shout(), passing it a single argument 'hello'.


 # Define echo_shout()
def echo_shout(word):
    """Change the value of a nonlocal variable"""
    
    # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word
    echo_word = word * 2
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)
    
    # Define inner function shout()
    def shout():
        """Alter a variable in the enclosing scope"""    
        # Use echo_word in nonlocal scope
        nonlocal echo_word
        
        # Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'
        echo_word = echo_word + '!!!'
    
    # Call function shout()
    shout()
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)

# Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'
echo_shout('hello')                 
                  
  __________________________________________________Default and Flexible Arguments_________________________________________________________________________

Default arguments and flexible arguments 
      Let's say  you're writing a functon that takes multiple parameters & that there is a common values for some of these parameters.
			In this case you would like to be able to call the function without explicityly specifiying every parameter. 
			In other words you would like some parameters to have default arguments that are used when it isn't specified otherwise. 

In this unit, you'll learn to:
	-Write functions with default arguments
	Use flexible arguments which allow ypu to pass any number of arguments to a functions
	
	
Add a default argument
	-First up to define a function with a default argument value in the function header, we follow the parameter of interest with an equals sign and the default argument value. 
	-Notice this function raises the first argument to the power of the second argument and the default 2nd argument value is 1. 
	
	ex: 
	def power(number, pow=1):
			"""Raise number to the power of now."""
			new_value = number ** pow
			return new_value
			
	So you can call the function using 2 arguments as you would expect but if you use only one argument then it uses the default value. 
	
	
Let's now look at a flexible argument:
		Let's say that you want to write a function but aren't sure how many arguments a user will want to pass it
		
		Flexible arguments:  *args(1)
		For example, a function that takes floats or ints adn adds them all up, irrespective of how many there are.
		In this example we write the function that sums up all the arguments passed to it. 
		In the function definition, we use the parameter star followed by args: this then turns all the arguments passed to a function call into a tuple called args in the functon body;
			then, in the funcition body, to write our desired function, we initialize our sum sum_all to 0, loop over the tuple args and add each element of it successively to sum_all and then return it.
		We can now call our function add_all with any number of arguments to add them all up!
		
		
		def add_all(*args):
				"""Sum all values in *args together."""
				
				# Initialize sum 
                  		sum_all = 0
				
				#Accumulate the sum
				for num in args:
					sum_all += num
					
				return sum_all	
                  
                  
                Flexible Arguments: **kwargs
		Can also use a double star to pass arbitrary number of keyword arguments, also called kwargs, that is arguments preceded by identifiers.    
		
		We'll write a function  that prints the identifiers and parameters passed to them as you see here.
		Now to write such a function we'll use the parameter kwargs preceded by a double star.
		This turns the identyifier -keyword pairs into a dictionary within the function body. 
		Then in the functiuon body all we need to do is to print all the key-value pairs stored in the dictionary kwargs. 
		Note that it is not the names args and kwargs that are important when using flexible arguments, but rather that they're preceded by a single and double start, respectively. 
		
		
		
		def print_all(**kwargs):
				"""Print out key-value pairs in **kwargs."""
				
				# Print out the key-value pairs
				for key, value in kwargs.items():
					print(key + ": "+value)
		print_all(name="Hugo", employer="DataCamp")
