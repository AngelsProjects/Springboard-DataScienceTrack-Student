---------Customizing Plots---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plotting multiple graphs
Strategies:

  -Plotting many graphs on a common axis
  -Creating axes within a figure
  -Creating subplots within a figure
  
  
Ex:
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
		plt.plot(t,dewpoint,'b') #Appears on same axes
	plt.xlabel('Date')
		plt.title('Temperature & Dew Point')
		plt.show() #Renders plot objects t screen

Using axes
	Laying figures out with separate axes side by side

			plt.axes([0.05,0.05,0.425,0.9])
			plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Temperature')
			plt.axes([0.05,0.05,0.425,0.9])
			plt.plot(t, dewpoint,'b')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Dew Point')
			plt.show()

					
The axes() command
	-Syntx: axes([x_lo, y_lo, width, height])
	-Units between 0 and 1 (figure dimensions)
					
Using subplot()
	Ex: for the 2 graphs in top of eah other
	
			plt.subplot(2,1,1)
			plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Temperature')
			plt.subplot(2,1,2)
			plt.plot(t, dewpoint,'b')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Dew Point')
			plt.tight_layout()
					
					
The subplot()command
	-Syntax: subplot(nrows, ncols, nsubplot)
	-Subplot ordering:
		-Row-wise from top left
		-Indexed from 1

  Multiple plots on single axis
It is time now to put together some of what you have learned and combine line plots on a common set of axes. The data set here comes from records of undergraduate degrees awarded to women in a variety of fields from 1970 to 2011. You can compare trends in degrees most easily by viewing two curves on the same set of axes.

Here, three NumPy arrays have been pre-loaded for you: year (enumerating years from 1970 to 2011 inclusive), physical_sciences (representing the percentage of Physical Sciences degrees awarded to women each in corresponding year), and computer_science (representing the percentage of Computer Science degrees awarded to women in each corresponding year).

You will issue two plt.plot() commands to draw line plots of different colors on the same set of axes. Here, year represents the x-axis, while physical_sciences and computer_science are the y-axes.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import matplotlib.pyplot as its usual alias.
Add a 'blue' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences (physical_sciences) from 1970 to 2011 (year). Note that the x-axis should be specified first.
Add a 'red' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science (computer_science) from 1970 to 2011 (year).
Use plt.show() to display the figure with the curves on the same axes.


  
  
  # Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color = 'blue')

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color = 'red')

# Display the plot
plt.show()



 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________
 Using axes()
Rather than overlaying line plots on common axes, you may prefer to plot different line plots on distinct axes. The command plt.axes() is one way to do this (but it requires specifying coordinates relative to the size of the figure).

Here, you have the same three arrays year, physical_sciences, and computer_science representing percentages of degrees awarded to women over a range of years. You will use plt.axes() to create separate sets of axes in which you will draw each line plot.

In calling plt.axes([xlo, ylo, width, height]), a set of axes is created and made active with lower corner at coordinates (xlo, ylo) of the specified width and height. Note that these coordinates can be passed to plt.axes() in the form of a list or a tuple.

The coordinates and lengths are values between 0 and 1 representing lengths relative to the dimensions of the figure. After issuing a plt.axes() command, plots generated are put in that set of axes.

Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.05 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Note: Remember to pass these coordinates to plt.axes() in the form of a list: [xlo, ylo, width, height].
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active axes just created.
Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.525 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active axes just created.
  
  
  # Create plot axes for the first line plot
plt.axes([0.05, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Create plot axes for the second line plot
plt.axes([0.525, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')


# Display the plot
plt.show()

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using subplot() (1)
The command plt.axes() requires a lot of effort to use well because the coordinates of the axes need to be set manually. A better alternative is to use plt.subplot() to determine the layout automatically.

In this exercise, you will continue working with the same arrays from the previous exercises: year, physical_sciences, and computer_science. Rather than using plt.axes() to explicitly lay out the axes, you will use plt.subplot(m, n, k) to make the subplot grid of dimensions m by n and to make the kth subplot active (subplots are numbered starting from 1 row-wise from the top left corner of the subplot grid).

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use plt.subplot() to create a figure with 1x2 subplot layout & make the first subplot active.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Use plt.subplot() again to make the second subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.



# Create a figure with 1x2 subplot and make the left subplot active
plt.subplot(1,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the right subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(1,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Use plt.tight_layout() to improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

  
  
  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  
  
  Using subplot() (2)
Now you have some familiarity with plt.subplot(), you can use it to plot more plots in larger grids of subplots of the same figure.

Here, you will make a 2×2 grid of subplots and plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences (using physical_sciences), in Computer Science (using computer_science), in Health Professions (using health), and in Education (using education).

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Create a figure with 2×2 subplot layout, make the top, left subplot active, and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Make the top, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, left subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions in green in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Education in yellow in the active subplot.


# Create a figure with 2x2 subplot layout and make the top left subplot active
plt.subplot(2,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the top right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid 
plt.subplot(2,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Make the bottom left subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,3)

# Plot in green the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions
plt.plot(year, health, color='green')
plt.title('Health Professions')

# Make the bottom right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,4)


# Plot in yellow the % of degrees awarded to women in Education
plt.plot(year, education, color='yellow')
plt.title('Education')

# Improve the spacing between subplots and display them
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Customizing axes:

Controlling axis extents -- sa you want to zoom in on a part

		-axis([xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]) sets axis elements
		-Control over individual axis extents
			-xlim([xmin, xmax])
			-ylim([ymin, ymax])
		-Can use tuples, lists for extents
			e.g. xlim((-2,3)) works
			e.g. xlim([-2,3]) works also
			
			
GDP over time

		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		plt.plot(yr, gdp)
		plt.xlabel('Year')
		plt.ylabel('Billions of Doollars')
		plt.title('US Gross Domestic product')
		plt.show()
		
		
		
  Using xlim (can limit the x view):
  
  		plt.plot(yr, gdp)
		plt.xlabel('Year')
		plt.ylabel('Billions of Dollars')
		plt.title('US Gross Domestic Product')
		plt.xlim((1947,1957))
		plt.show()
		
		
  
  
  Using xlim & ylim:
  
  		plt.plot(yr, gdp)
		plt.xlabel('Year')
		plt.ylabel('Billions of Dollars')
		plt.title('US Gross Domestic Product')
		plt.xlim((1947,1957))
		plt.ylim((0,1000))
		plt.show()
		
  
  
  
  Using axis (can replace xlim & ylim all at once):

		plt.plot(yr, gdp)
		plt.xlabel('Year')
		plt.ylabel('Billions of Dollars')
		plt.title('US Gross Domestic Product')
		plt.axis((1947,1957,0,600))
		plt.show()
  
  
  
  Other axis() options:
  
  	axis('off') - turns off axis lines, labels
	axis('equal') - equal scaling on x, y axes
	axis('square') - forces square plot
	axis('tight') - sets xlim(), ylim() to show all data
	
	
	
  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using xlim(), ylim()
In this exercise, you will work with the matplotlib.pyplot interface to quickly set the x- and y-limits of your plots.

You will now create the same figure as in the previous exercise using plt.plot(), this time setting the axis extents using plt.xlim() and plt.ylim(). These commands allow you to either zoom or expand the plot or to set the axis ranges to include important values (such as the origin).

In this exercise, as before, the percentage of women graduates in Computer Science and in the Physical Sciences are held in the variables computer_science and physical_sciences respectively over year.

After creating the plot, you will use plt.savefig() to export the image produced to a file.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use plt.xlim() to set the x-axis range to the period between the years 1990 and 2010.
Use plt.ylim() to set the y-axis range to the interval between 0% and 50% of degrees awarded.
Display the final figure with plt.show() and save the output to 'xlim_and_ylim.png'.


# Plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science and the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year,computer_science, color='red') 
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Add the axis labels
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Degrees awarded to women (%)')

# Set the x-axis range
plt.xlim((1990,2010))

# Set the y-axis range
plt.ylim((0, 50))

# Add a title and display the plot
plt.title('Degrees awarded to women (1990-2010)\nComputer Science (red)\nPhysical Sciences (blue)')
plt.show()

# Save the image as 'xlim_and_ylim.png'
plt.savefig('xlim_and_ylim.png')



________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using axis()
Using plt.xlim() and plt.ylim() are useful for setting the axis limits individually. In this exercise, you will see how you can pass a 4-tuple to plt.axis() to set limits for both axes at once. For example, plt.axis((1980,1990,0,75)) would set the extent of the x-axis to the period between 1980 and 1990, and would set the y-axis extent from 0 to 75% degrees award.

Once again, the percentage of women graduates in Computer Science and in the Physical Sciences are held in the variables computer_science and physical_sciences where each value was measured at the corresponding year held in the year variable.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use plt.axis() to select the time period between 1990 and 2010 on the x-axis as well as the interval between 0 and 50% awarded on the y-axis.
Save the resulting plot as 'axis_limits.png'.

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year,computer_science, color='blue')

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences,color='red')

# Set the x-axis and y-axis limits
plt.axis((1990,2010,0,50))

# Show the figure
plt.show()

# Save the figure as 'axis_limits.png'

plt.savefig('axis_limits.png')
