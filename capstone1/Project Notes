Nice to e-meet you!
I am sharing now 2 data sets that might be relevant to what you are looking for: the ones that I've sent out for estimation of third party companies that provide a service of lead scoring.
To give you a quick background: we score leads at the moment as they enter the salesforce and then we filter out low scored leads (D bucket). The ABC leads are assigned further to SDR's. 
We also use scores to optimize our campaigns and evaluate the quality of the leads that we're bringing. 

I am attaching 2 files: 
1. training data set for the lead scoring model, which is basically a set of ~20000 leads from our salesforce from Q2 2018 with ~400 positives. Outbound leads and leads with status "SE Qualified" were filtered out. Vendors' goal was to train the model using a qualified parameter as positive (field "Status" with value "Qualified"). 
2. Testing data set - where we checked the prediction ability of the model. It's a smaller set from different time period. Positive results were removed for the vendors, the accuracy of prediction was evaluated based on "Qualified" parameter.

After the test that was used for evaluation, we've chosen a company that built the initial scoring model (this model was later changed to the one that we are using now where we use schedules as positives).
