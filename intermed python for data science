Comparison Operators

Numpy Recap

---------------Filtering Pandas DataFrame--------------------

Goal: Selext countries with area over 8m km^2
Steps:
1) Select the area column
2) Comparison on area column
3) Use result to select countries


Step 1: Get column
Want Pandas Series (single bracket) as opposed to DataFRame (double bracket)
Use
  brics["area"]
  
Step 2: To find areas greater tahn 8,
  brics["area"]>8
Will give series of True/False correspinding to which values were greater than 8

Can then store the boolean seriesas "is_huge" 
  is_huge = brics["area]>8
  
Step 3: Then to select countries, can do
  brics[is_huge]
  
To combine steps 1-3, just do
  brics[brics["area"]>8]
  
 
 Using Boolean operators in conjuction with filtering Data:
