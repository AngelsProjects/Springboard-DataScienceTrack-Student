Pandas DataFrames are the most widely used in-memory representation of complex data collections within Python. Whether in finance, scientific fields, or data science, a familiarity with Pandas is essential. This course teaches you to work with real-world data sets containing both string and numeric data, often structured around time series. You will learn powerful analysis, selection, and visualization techniques in this course.

Data ingestion & inspection

Review of pandas Data Frames
    -pandas is for data analysis
    -power tool of pandas is DataFrame - tabular data sgtructure with labeled rows & columns
      -rows are labeled by Index- special data structure
        -indexes are tailored lists of labels that permit fast look-up & powerful relational operations
        
      
    ex: 
          import pandas as pd  ###AAPL is an example Pandas DataFrame 
          type(AAPL)  ### Gives # of rows and # of columns as tuple
          AAPL.shape
          AAPL.columns ###List the name of the columns
          
Pandas DataFRames can be sliced like NumPy arrays or Python lists using colons to specify the start, end and stride of a slice
          We can slice using the .iloc accessor to express the slice positionally

        ex: 
        
            AAPL.iloc[:5,:]
            AAPL.iloc[-5:,:]   ###Next we can slice from the 5th last row to the end of the DataFrame using a negative index
            
            ### Also possible to slice using labels with the .loc accessor
            
 head()
        Another way to see just the top rows of a DataFrame: the head method
        Specifying head(5) returns the first 5 rows
        
            AAPL.head(5)
        
tail()   

        AAPL.tail()   - default is 5
        
info()

        AAPL.info() - returns the metadata
        
        
 Broadcasting
 
        import numpy as np
        AAPL.iloc[::3,-1] = mp.nan     ###  <=== Assigning scalar value to column slice broadcasts value to each row (like NaN in this case)
        AAPL.head(6)   
      
                ### Slice consists of every 3rd row starting from zero in the last column
                
                
Series
    Columns of a DataFrame are themselves a specialized Pandas structure called a Series
    Extracting a single column from Pandas returns a Series
    Notice the Series extracted has its own head() method and inherits its name attribute from the DataFrame column
    
            low = AAPL['Low']
            type(low)
            low.head()
            lows = low.values
            type(lows)
                
    To extract the numerical entries from the Series, use the values attribute
    The data in the Series actually form a Numpy Array which is what the values attribute yields
    A pandas Series, then, is a 1D labelled NumPy array and a DataFrame is a 2D labelled array whose columns are Series
    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    
    
DataFrame data types
Pandas is aware of the data types in the columns of your DataFrame. It is also aware of null and NaN ('Not-a-Number') types which often indicate missing data. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in the world population data which contains some NaN values, a value often used as a place-holder for missing or otherwise invalid data entries. Your job is to use df.info() to determine information about the total count of non-null entries and infer the total count of 'null' entries, which likely indicates missing data. Select the best description of this data set from the following:

NumPy and pandas working together
Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, you can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame df as a NumPy array. You can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. This dataset was derived from the one used in the previous exercise.

Your job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. You'll then use those values as input into the NumPy np.log10() method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, you will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy np.log10() method and compare the results.

Import numpy using the standard alias np.
Assign the numerical values in the DataFrame df to an array np_vals using the attribute values.
Pass np_vals into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in np_vals_log10.
Pass the entire df DataFrame into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in df_log10.
Inspect the output of the print() code to see the type() of the variables that you created.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values

# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)

# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)

# Print original and new data containers
[print(x, 'has type', type(eval(x))) for x in ['np_vals', 'np_vals_log10', 'df', 'df_log10']]

Building DataFrames from Scratch

        -We've seen how to work with DataFrames in memory but how do we get them in memory?
        
  DataFrames from CSV files
        - In prior course, we used read_csv to load a DataFrame from a csv file
        

        -Example: Here we use a file users.csv to create a DataFrame called users
                    The file records visitors to a blog for a band and who signed up for the newsletter.
                    By tracking where visitors come from, this information can help design tours later. 
                    DataFrames can also be rolled by hand using dictionaries.
        
                import pandas as pd
                users = pd.read_csv('datasets/users.csv', index_col=0)
                print(users)

DataFrames from dict(1)
        -DataFrames can also be rolled by hand using dictionaries
        -Dictionaries (or associative arrays) are a core data structure in Python
            -Here we construct a dictionary of lists with the same users data
            Keys of dictionary data are used as column labels
            Notice with no index specified, the row labels are the integers zero to three by default
            
                        import pandas as pd
                        data = {'weekyday': ['Sun', 'Sun', 'Mon', 'Mon],
                                'city': ['Austin', 'Dallas', 'Austin', 'Dallas'],
                                'visitors':[139,237,326,456],
                                'singups':[7,12,3,5]}
                                
                         users = pd.DataFrame(data)       
        

DataFrames from dict(2)
    import pandas as pd
    
    ### Common for data to come in form of lists
    cities = ['Austin','Dallas','Austin','Dallas']
    signups = [7, 12, 3, 5]
    visitors = [139,237,326,456]
    weekdays = ['Sun', 'Sun', 'Mon', 'Mon]

    
    ###Can then define other lists: list_labels  & list cols
    
    list_labels = ['city', 'signups', 'visitors', 'weekday']
    list_cols = [cities, signups, visitors, weekdays]   ###<= Notice this is a list of lists
    
    zipped = list(zip(list_labels, list_cols))  ###Using pyton's list and zip functions constructus a list called zipped of tupls (column names and columns) to feed to the dict command. 
    
    ### Calling dict(zipped) creates a dict data which is then used with pd.DataFrame to build the DataFrame
    data = dict(zipped)
    users = pd.DataFRame(data)
    
    
Broadcasting

        -a convenient technique in NumPy & Pandas
        -with users in memory, a new colun, can be created on the fly 
        -Broadcasting saves time in generating long lists, arrays, or columns
    
    users['fees'] = 0 ### New columns fees is created and value = 0 is broadcast to entire column
    
    
    
Broadcasting with a dict
        -Broadcasting isn;t restricted to numbers
        -Here we create a dictionary data with column lables height and sex as keys and a list and a single-character string 'M' as values
        -When the dict data is used to create DataFrame results, the value 'M' is broadcast to the entire column
        
        
        import pandas as pd
        heights = [59.0, 65.2, 62.9, 65.4, 63.7, 65.7, 64.1]
        data = {'height':heights, 'sex':'M'}
        results = pd.DataFrame(data)
        
Index and Columns

        Remember we can change the column and index labels using the columns and index attributes of a Pandas DataFrame
        We can assign lists of strings to the attributes columns and index as long as they are of suitable length (that is, the number of columns and rows respectively)
        
        
                results.columns = ['height (in)', 'sex']
                results.index = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']

Zip lists to build a DataFrame
In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from Wikipedia.

Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd.

Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2).

Zip the 2 lists list_keys and list_values together into one list of (key, value) tuples. Be sure to convert the zip object into a list, and store the result in zipped.
Inspect the contents of zipped using print(). This has been done for you.
Construct a dictionary using zipped. Store the result as data.
Construct a DataFrame using the dictionary. Store the result as df.

# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys, list_values))

# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)

# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)

# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-

Labeling your data
You can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame.

In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from Wikipedia). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Your job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a list of new column labels with 'year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks', and assign it to list_labels.
Assign your list of labels to df.columns.

# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks']

# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Building DataFrames with broadcasting
You can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. In this exercise, you're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities.

Your job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

Instructions
100 XP
Make a string object with the value 'PA' and assign it to state.
Construct a dictionary with 2 key:value pairs: 'state':state and 'city':cities.
Construct a pandas DataFrame from the dictionary you created and assign it to df.

# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'

# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}

# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

Importing  &  Exporting Data

dataSets from CSV files
    Read csv functions requires a string describing a filepath as input
    We read into a DataFrame sunspots
    Notuce the index of the DataFra,e (the row labales) are of a type Range Index (just integers)
    
    
        import pandas as pd
        filepath = 'ISSN_D_tot.csv'
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        sunspots.info()
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]       #### Using the accessor.iloc to view a slice of the middle of the DataFrame
    

Example data set: SILSO sunspots data set

    Problems 
        CSV file has no column headers
        Missing values
        As written, dates are awakward for CSV files
        
      
      
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None)  ###Using header =None prevents pandas from assuming the first line of the file gives column labels
        
        
Using names keyword     
        
        We can explicitly define the column names using the names keyword
        
        col_names = ['year', 'month', 'day', 'dec_date', 'sunspots', 'definite']
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names)
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]
 
 
 Using na_values keyword(1)
 
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names, na_values='-1')  ## We try na_values equals "-1" but in this case will need " -1" 
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]
        
        
        We can also read the negative one entries in the sunspots with the na_values keyword
        
        
 Using na_values keyword(3) 
        Note it's possible using distinct patterns for null values & multipl values
        
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names = col_names, na_values={'sunspots':['-1']})
        
        
        
Using  parse_date keyword  
        The prase_dates keyword in read_csv infers dates intelligently
        We use a list of lists of column positons (indexed from 0) to inform read_csv which columns hold the dates
        
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names, na_values={'sunspots':['-1]}, parse_dates=[[0,1,2]]) ### This combines three columns (month, day, year)
        
        
        
Trimming redundant columns
        Only include meaningful columns 
        
        cols = ['sunspots','definite']
        sunspots = sunspots[cols]
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]
        
        
        
Writing Files     
        Share files with others
        
            out_csv = 'sunspots'.csv
            sunspots.to_csv(out_csv)

Reading a flat file
In previous exercises, we have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's your turn! Your job is to read the World Bank population data you saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file.

The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. You will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.

Finish up by inspecting the result with df.head() and df.info() in the IPython Shell (changing df to the name of your DataFrame variable).

pandas has already been imported and is available in the workspace as pd.

Instructions
100 XP
Use pd.read_csv() with the string data_file to read the CSV file into a DataFrame and assign it to df1.
Create a list of new column labels - 'year', 'population' - and assign it to the variable new_labels.
Reread the same file, again using pd.read_csv(), but this time, add the keyword arguments header=0 and names=new_labels. Assign the resulting DataFrame to df2.
Print both the df1 and df2 DataFrames to see the change in column names. This has already been done for you.

# Read in the file: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['year','population']

# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(data_file, header=0, names=new_labels)

# Print both the DataFrames
print(df1)
print(df2)

Delimiters, headers, and extensions
Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that you encounter far too often.

In this exercise, you have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to you in the variable file_messy.

In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas.

Your job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for you, as you might do in a real data workflow.

You can learn about the option input parameters needed by using help() on the pandas function pd.read_csv().

Use pd.read_csv() without using any keyword arguments to read file_messy into a pandas DataFrame df1.
Use .head() to print the first 5 rows of df1 and see how messy it is. Do this in the IPython Shell first so you can see how modifying read_csv() can clean up this mess.
Using the keyword arguments delimiter=' ', header=3 and comment='#', use pd.read_csv() again to read file_messy into a new DataFrame df2.
Print the output of df2.head() to verify the file was read correctly.
Use the DataFrame method .to_csv() to save the DataFrame df2 to the variable file_clean. Be sure to specify index=False.
Use the DataFrame method .to_excel() to save the DataFrame df2 to the file 'file_clean.xlsx'. Again, remember to specify index=False.


# Read the raw file as-is: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)

# Print the output of df1.head()
print(df1.head())

# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment='#')

# Print the output of df2.head()
print(df2.head())

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index
df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an excel file without the index
df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)

Plotting with Pandas


AAPL Stock Data
    
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    aapl = pd.read_csv('aapl.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=True)  ###Notice the options parse_date = True & index_col='date' to force a datetime64 index
    aapl.head(6)
    
    
Plotting arrays (matplotlib)

    close_arr = aapl['close'].values   ###Now we assign close_arr by indexing aapl 'close' (yielding a Series) and applying the values method (yielding a NumPy array) 
    type(close_arr)                                    #### Remember the command plot can plot NumPy arrays or lists & the command show must be executed to make the plot visible
    numpy.ndarray

    plt.plot(close_arr)
    plt.show() 
    

We can plot a Pandas series directly

    close_series = aapl['close']
    type(close_series)  ### displays that in this case it's a pandas Series
    plt.plot(close_series)  ###Plot automatically uses tje Serie's datetime index labels along the horizontal axis
    plt.show() 
    

An even nicer method is to plot series (Pandas)

        close_series.plot()  ###Plot series directly
        plt.show()
        
        
 Plotting DataFrames (pandas)
 
        aapl.plot()
        plt.show()

 Plotting series using pandas
Data visualization is often a very effective first step in gaining a rough understanding of a data set to be analyzed. Pandas provides data visualization by both depending upon and interoperating with the matplotlib library. You will now explore some of the basic plotting mechanics with pandas as well as related matplotlib options. We have pre-loaded a pandas DataFrame df which contains the data you need. Your job is to use the DataFrame method df.plot() to visualize the data, and then explore the optional matplotlib input parameters that this .plot() method accepts.

The pandas .plot() method makes calls to matplotlib to construct the plots. This means that you can use the skills you've learned in previous visualization courses to customize the plot. In this exercise, you'll add a custom title and axis labels to the figure.

Before plotting, inspect the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using df.head(). Also, use type(df) and note that it is a single column DataFrame.

Create the plot with the DataFrame method df.plot(). Specify a color of 'red'.
Note: c and color are interchangeable as parameters here, but we ask you to be explicit and specify color.
Use plt.title() to give the plot a title of 'Temperature in Austin'.
Use plt.xlabel() to give the plot an x-axis label of 'Hours since midnight August 1, 2010'.
Use plt.ylabel() to give the plot a y-axis label of 'Temperature (degrees F)'.
Finally, display the plot using plt.show().
